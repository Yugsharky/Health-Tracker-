# Health-Tracker-

The Simple Health Tracker is a beginner-friendly Python project that helps users monitor basic health metrics. By entering personal information such as age, gender, weight, and height, the program calculates important health indicators like Body Mass Index (BMI) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).

BMI Calculation: Determines whether a user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

BMR Calculation: Estimates the number of calories a user needs daily to maintain their current weight.

This project introduces fundamental programming concepts such as functions, user input, conditional statements, and basic mathematical operations. It’s ideal for beginners looking to build a practical, real-world Python application.

Optional Extensions:

Track multiple users’ health data.

Save data to a CSV file for progress monitoring.

Visualize BMI trends over time with charts.
